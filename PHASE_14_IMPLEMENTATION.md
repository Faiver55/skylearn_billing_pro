- **User Consent Management**: Tools for managing user privacy preferences

**Usage**:
```php
$gdpr_tools = skylearn_billing_pro_gdpr_tools();
$export_data = $gdpr_tools->export_user_data('user@example.com');
$erase_result = $gdpr_tools->erase_user_data('user@example.com');
```

### 2. Audit Logging (`class-audit-logger.php`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive logging of all critical system events for security and compliance.

**Key Features**:
- **Custom Database Table**: Dedicated audit log storage with optimized schema
- **Event Types**: Admin actions, user actions, payments, enrollments, security events
- **Detailed Logging**: IP address, user agent, timestamps, and event details
- **Searchable Interface**: Admin dashboard with filtering, search, and pagination
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Configurable log retention and cleanup

**Event Types**:
- `admin`: Settings changes, product management, administrative actions
- `user`: Login, logout, registration, profile updates
- `payment`: Payment completions, refunds, subscription changes
- `enrollment`: Course enrollments, access grants
- `security`: Failed login attempts, capability violations, brute force attempts

**Usage**:
```php
$audit_logger = skylearn_billing_pro_audit_logger();
$audit_logger->log('payment', 'payment_completed', $payment_data, 'payment', $transaction_id);
```

### 3. Security Utilities (`class-security.php`)

**Purpose**: Enhanced security measures including nonce validation, input sanitization, and attack prevention.

**Key Features**:
- **Enhanced Nonce Verification**: Nonce validation with security event logging
- **Comprehensive Sanitization**: 15+ sanitization types with validation rules
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limiting for sensitive operations
- **Brute Force Protection**: Automatic IP blocking after failed login attempts
- **Security Headers**: HTTP security headers for XSS and clickjacking protection
- **Input Validation**: Form validation with error handling

**Sanitization Types**:
- `text`, `email`, `url`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `textarea`, `html`, `key`, `slug`, `user`, `file`, `hex_color`, `meta_key`, `sql`

**Usage**:
```php
$security = skylearn_billing_pro_security();
$clean_email = $security->sanitize_input($input, 'email');
$is_rate_limited = $security->is_rate_limited('password_reset', $user_id, 3, 900);
```

### 4. Performance Optimization (`class-performance.php`)

**Purpose**: Caching, query optimization, and performance monitoring for better user experience.

**Key Features**:
- **Object Caching**: WordPress object cache integration with custom cache groups
- **Query Optimization**: Database query reduction and optimization
- **Batch Processing**: Heavy operations broken into manageable chunks
- **Async Processing**: Background job scheduling for intensive tasks
- **Performance Metrics**: Memory usage, query count, and cache hit rate monitoring
- **Cache Management**: Automated cache invalidation and cleanup

**Caching Strategy**:
- Products: 30 minutes
- User Enrollments: 15 minutes  
- Payment Gateways: 1 hour
- Settings: Until change

**Usage**:
```php
$performance = skylearn_billing_pro_performance();
$data = $performance->get_cached('products_list', function() {
    return get_products_from_database();
}, 1800);
```

### 5. Role-Based Access Control (`class-role-access.php`)

**Purpose**: Fine-grained permissions management for different user roles and capabilities.

**Key Features**:
- **Custom Capabilities**: 8 granular capabilities for billing features
- **Role Configuration**: Configurable capability assignment per WordPress role
- **Menu Filtering**: Admin menu items filtered based on user capabilities
- **Page Access Control**: Automatic capability checking for admin pages
- **Custom Roles**: Support for creating custom roles with specific capabilities

**Custom Capabilities**:
- `skylearn_manage_billing`: Manage billing settings
- `skylearn_view_reports`: View reports and analytics
- `skylearn_manage_products`: Manage products and bundles
- `skylearn_manage_enrollments`: Manage user enrollments
- `skylearn_manage_payments`: Manage payment settings
- `skylearn_view_logs`: View audit logs
- `skylearn_manage_privacy`: Manage privacy settings
- `skylearn_export_data`: Export user data

**Default Role Assignments**:

- Search functionality across actions and details
- Modal popup for detailed event information
- Pagination for large log sets
- Color-coded event types
