# Skylearn Billing Pro – Detailed Phase Plan (continued)

---

## Phase 10: Subscription & Membership Management

### Tasks:
- [ ] Build subscription manager (handle multiple tiers, bundles, pause/resume, upgrades/downgrades, renewals).
- [ ] Develop membership manager (access control, membership levels).
- [ ] Integrate loyalty/reward logic for subscribers.
- [ ] Create admin interfaces for managing plans, upgrades, downgrades, and nurturing popups.
- [ ] Add triggers for membership/subscription actions (e.g., after payment, on renewal, on cancellation).

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Admin can create/manage subscription and membership plans (StoreEngine-style sidebar/tabs).
- Users can upgrade, downgrade, pause, resume, or renew subscriptions from portal.
- Loyalty/reward features are configurable and visible in the portal.
- Nurturing popups and flows (cancel, upgrade, renew) appear at correct events and are customizable.
- Membership levels correctly restrict access to products, courses, and content.

**UI Notes:**  
- Admin UI for plans should mimic StoreEngine’s plan/product management screens.
- User portal shows current plan, allows actions, and shows loyalty/reward status.

## Phase 11: Addons & Extensibility

### Tasks:
- [ ] Build addon manager (install, activate, update free/paid addons; show available addons in UI).
- [ ] Implement system for checking license/feature eligibility for paid addons.
- [ ] Add initial addons (webhook, email, affiliate, reporting, etc.).
- [ ] Provide developer documentation for building addons (hooks, filters, best practices).

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Admin can view, install, activate, deactivate, and update addons from the dashboard.
- Addon manager clearly separates free/paid addons and shows upgrade prompts for paid features.
- Addons are loaded conditionally and do not break the main plugin.
- Developer documentation is accessible in the admin/help section.

**UI Notes:**  
- Addon UI follows StoreEngine’s add-on panel: sidebar navigation, cards/toggles, tier badges.
- Upgrade prompts match StoreEngine’s “Get Pro” style.

## Phase 12: Automation & Integration

### Tasks:
- [ ] Build automation manager (visual builder for triggers/actions, template library, logs).
- [ ] Integrate webhook handler for third-party services (Zapier, Pabbly, ActivePieces, etc.).
- [ ] Create UI for building automations (drag-and-drop or form-based).
- [ ] Log automation events with status/error reporting.
- [ ] Provide basic integrations with email, CRM, SMS, and marketing tools.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Admin can create automations using visual builder or template library.
- Automations trigger on payment, subscription, enrollment, etc., and send data to connected services.
- Logs show automation events, success/failure, and allow debugging.
- Integration setup is user-friendly and offers clear feedback (StoreEngine-style info modals).

**UI Notes:**  
- Automation builder UI should be modular, with cards/rows for triggers/actions.
- Logs use sortable tables/cards for easy review.
