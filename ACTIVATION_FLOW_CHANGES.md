# SkyLearn Billing Pro - Activation Flow Changes

## Problem Fixed
The plugin was experiencing a 404 error during activation because it tried to create pages immediately during the `register_activation_hook` callback, when AJAX handlers weren't yet available.

## Solution Implemented
Changed the activation flow to redirect users to the onboarding wizard instead of creating pages immediately.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Plugin Activation (`skylearn-billing-pro.php`)
- **Before**: Pages were created immediately via `do_action('skylearn_billing_pro_activate')`
- **After**: Sets a redirect flag and redirects to onboarding wizard after activation
- **New Method**: `handle_activation_redirect()` handles the redirect to onboarding

### 2. Page Setup (`includes/page-setup.php`)
- **Before**: Hooked into `skylearn_billing_pro_activate` to create pages immediately
- **After**: Removed automatic page creation on activation
- **Result**: Pages are only created via onboarding completion or manual admin action

### 3. Page Generator (`includes/frontend/page-generator.php`)
- **Before**: Hooked into `skylearn_billing_pro_activate` to create pages immediately  
- **After**: Removed automatic page creation on activation
- **Result**: Pages are only created when explicitly requested

### 4. Onboarding Process (`includes/class-onboarding.php`)
- **Enhancement**: Now creates pages when onboarding is completed or skipped
- **New Method**: `create_initial_pages()` safely creates pages after onboarding
- **Result**: Pages are created at the right time in the user flow

4. AJAX handlers not available → 404 error
5. User sees broken experience

### After (Fixed)
1. Plugin activated
2. Redirect flag set
3. User redirected to onboarding wizard
4. User completes or skips onboarding
5. Pages created successfully after onboarding
6. User has smooth experience
