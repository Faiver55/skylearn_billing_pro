## Phase 13: Analytics & Reporting

### Tasks:
- [ ] Build analytics dashboard (sales, enrollments, subscriptions) with real-time and historical data.

- [ ] Add filters (by date, product, user, gateway) and sortable columns for granular data views.
- [ ] Allow exporting reports (CSV, PDF).
- [ ] Integrate analytics with product, LMS, and portal actions.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Analytics dashboard displays key metrics in cards, charts, and tables (StoreEngine-style widgets).
- Admin can create custom reports and schedule exports.
- Reports can be filtered, sorted, and exported in multiple formats.
- AI insights (if available) highlight trends, anomalies, and actionable data.
- Data updates in real time or on schedule.

**UI Notes:**  
- Use modular dashboard cards, sortable tables, and clear filter dropdowns/tabs.
- Export buttons follow StoreEngine design (icon, clear label).

## Phase 14: Security, Compliance & Performance

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement GDPR/privacy tools (data export/delete, user consent, privacy settings).
- [ ] Add audit logging (admin actions, user actions, payments, enrollment).
- [ ] Apply best security practices (nonce, capability checks, sanitization/validation).
- [ ] Optimize performance (caching, async processing for heavy tasks, minimal queries).
- [ ] Provide role-based access controls for admin features.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Admin can manage privacy settings and export/delete user data.
- Audit log records all critical events and is accessible in the dashboard.
- Security checks prevent unauthorized access and actions.
- Plugin performs efficiently under load (tested with sample data).
- Role-based access controls are configurable.

**UI Notes:**  
- Audit logs displayed in sortable table with filter/search.
- Privacy settings accessible under settings tab (StoreEngine-style).

## Phase 15: Frontend Pages & Shortcodes

### Tasks:
- [ ] Build page generator for required frontend pages (dashboard, checkout, thank you, portal, etc.).
- [ ] Implement shortcodes for core features (checkout, portal, order history, etc.).
- [ ] Develop Gutenberg blocks for main features (admin can insert blocks into pages).
- [ ] Ensure all frontend pages are responsive and theme-compatible.
- [ ] Add accessibility support (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Frontend pages are auto-created on plugin activation or via admin wizard.
- Shortcodes and blocks work in classic and block editors.
- Pages render correctly on major WP themes and are fully responsive.
- Accessibility checks pass (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum).

**UI Notes:**

- Shortcode/block UI follows StoreEngine’s clean, intuitive insertion and settings.
